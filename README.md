String-class

This is an object that extends the String class in Javascript. Using Prototype Oriented Programming, methods, procedures and instance attributes are added to the String class to support more string manipulation features.

Instructions to install, configure, and to run the programs

Because browsers have restrictions on referencing other files (cross-origin requests), it is necessary to run the tests on a local server. You can use npm install -g local-web-server.

The test scripts are added to SpecRunner.html, as well as the script to be tested. To view tests, start the server using the command ‘ws’ on terminal. Copy the localhost url to browser address bar. Select the SpecRunner.html to open.
